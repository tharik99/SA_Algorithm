# SA_Algorithm
This project studies and improves the performance of the Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization algorithm by analyzing the impact of two key parameters: Markov chain length (Lₖ) and cooling schedule.
The work focuses on enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining solution quality across different optimization landscapes. This study was presented at the Postgraduate Institute of Science Research Congress (RESCON 2024), Sri Lanka.
